                 I am a full-stack software engineer with an eye for style and detail. Before I switched careers and decided to pursue something I am passionate about, 
            I was a retail manager for many years at a successful local small-business. The experience I gained as a retail manager
        equipped me with the ability to juggle different tasks and roles on a team. As a software developer, I am always curious and eager to learn
        and constantly trying to sharpen my skills. When I am not coding, you will find me playing with my kids, reading my latest book, playing a video game, or working on my newest painting. 
         I am happiest when I am being challenged and able to show my creative side. <br /> <br />
